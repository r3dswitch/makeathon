# Future of Nature's economy - Tracking deforestation in Palm oil plantations in Indonesia
## Predicting supply chain risks in the palm oil industry using satellite imagery and machine learning
- We fuse multiple data sources to predict supply chain risks in the palm oil industry.
- Data includes satellite imagery, company ownership, forest cover loss, RSPO compliance status, RADD and GLAD alerts and Palm Oil Estates.
- We quantify regional risk, mapping estate ownership to companies and tracking deforestation in palm oil plantations in Indonesia -> idenitify supply chain risks due to violations of RSPO standards.

## Tracking deforestation in Palm oil plantations in Indonesia
- We use satellite imagery to track deforestation in palm oil plantations in Indonesia.
- We map the ownership to the plantations and the companies that are responsible for the deforestation.
- We use object detection to identify the palm plantations and its expansion in the forested areas.
